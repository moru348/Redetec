# Redetec_webapi

Created for a Google extension that detects redirects.
It can be used with redetec.moru3.dev.

Since it is processed on the server side, the IP address will not be revealed to the other site!

~~Stay tuned for the release!~~<br>
~~Development of Chrome extensions has been temporarily suspended. Currently only webapi is available.~~
## The api server has been temporarily stopped.
